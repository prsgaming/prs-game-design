## Our Vision

We strive to create a community-driven gaming ecosystem, prioritizing accessibility, collaboration, and meaningful engagement over profit.

## Our Mission

Power Resource & Strategy designs games and entertainment that bring joy, inspire strategy and critical thinking, and share valuable lessons with players of all skill levels. We commit to transparency in our business practices to build trust, empower communities, and promote healthy competition.

## Licensing Principles

All entertainment products and content (excluding identity trademarks) are intended to be released to the public domain on a structured timeline.

### Licensing Strategy

  * Gradual Rollout: Some products and expansions may undergo an initial phase of restricted development to protect creators' visions and ensure quality.
  * Transition to Openness: Over time, these products will shift to permissive licensing to encourage widespread use and adaptation, while preserving the integrity of the original designs.
  * Community Support: Exceptions will be made to provide access to underserved communities during the transition period.

## Commitment to Openness and Inclusion

Our goal is to ensure that everyone who wishes to enjoy a PRS game can do so without unnecessary barriers. By gradually adopting public domain licensing, we aim to make our products as accessible and inclusive as possible.
