## Licensing Principles

All entertainment products and content (excluding identity trademarks) are intended to be released to the public domain on a structured timeline as development objectives are met.

### Licensing Strategy

  * By default all content within this repository is licensed with Creative Commons "Attribution-NonCommercial-NoDerivatives".
    * This means you may download, print, play the game and come back with suggestions, you can share it with attribution, but you cannot change it or sell it.
  * Gradual Loosening: Works undergo this initial phase of restrive licensing to protect the creators' visions and ensure quality and brand integrity.
  * Transition to Openness: Over time, these products will shift to permissive licensing to encourage widespread use and adaptation, while preserving the integrity of the original designs.  

## Commitment to Openness and Inclusion

Our goal is to ensure that everyone who wishes to enjoy a PRS game can do so without unnecessary barriers. By gradually adopting public domain licensing, we aim to make our products as accessible and inclusive as possible.
