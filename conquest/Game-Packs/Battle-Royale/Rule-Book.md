Battle Royale
=============

These stipulations override the standard rules for Conquest.

# Setup Scenario

Unlike the standard Conquest setup, resources are not placed on every tile.

Resources are randomized and placed face down on the outer perimeter of the board.

# No standard cards

Do not use any standard cards, including Edicts, Global Situations & Diplomatic Engagements.

Only use the cards from this expansion pack.

# Mobilization

A population unit may only push one resource over a borderland per turn.

A population unit that is used to push a resource over a borderland is not allowed to move that turn.

## Clarification

If two resources and two populations are all on one tile, both resources may be pushed while both
populations remain there. Alternatively, one resource may be pushed and one population unit may move.

# Famine

The need for resources is inverse from the standard Conquest game.

A "General Famine" is in effect by default. This means units must have a supply line to a resource
in order to combat with the corresponding weapon type, and if that combat takes place, that resource
is removed from the board.

Droughts do not replace the general famine, but they may make it easier to use a certain weapon. For
example a "Wood Drought" means that the unit needs a supply line to a wood resource, but it is not
removed from the game. This has no effect on other resources, unless their droughts appear as well.

Surplusses are introduced. They enable players to be able to use weapons in combat without any possession
of its corresponding resource.

# Railways

Railways are in effect by default. However unlike the standard Conquest railway rule, resources must
be pushed from a tile that has a population unit on it.

# Victory Conditions

There is no point scoring. The last player on the board wins.
