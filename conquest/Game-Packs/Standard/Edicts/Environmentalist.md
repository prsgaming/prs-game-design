End game score

## Instructions

At end of game, all of your controlled wood resources score +1 point.

At end of game, all metal resources within or adjacent to your controlled tiles score -2 point.

## Clarifications

The intended outcome is that wood resources are worth 2 and metal are worth -1. But effect scoring
takes place separately from end-game scoring.
