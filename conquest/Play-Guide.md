# PRS Conquest Play Guide

This is a brief set of instructions to walk players through the progress of a game of Conquest. A beginner
should be able to follow this guide and play a relatively coherent game.

For clarification on game pieces, stages, phases, and common rules, refer to the [Game Guide](./Game-Guide.md).

For complete authoritative game rules, refer to the [Rule Book](./Rule-Book/Index.md).

## Introduction

The game is broken up into 3 main stages, which are broken down further into phases. It may sound like a lot
of steps, but they progress quickly. In the sections that follow, you will read about game stages that prepare
a players and the game scenario, then "contest" which is the main game stage that repeats until the end-game,
and then final stages for determining victory conditions.

## About PRS Conquest

Conquest is a game that should be accessible to play by primary school aged children and challenging for
experienced strategists and tacticians alike. The spirit of the game is based on the amorality of geopolitical
contests and the conflicts that arise in the pursuit of party interests even when those interests are dissimilar.   

# Playing the Game

## Game Stage: Setup

The "Setup" game stage is all about setting up the game prior to starting the main "Contest".

### Rules of Engagement

Players agree on the parameters of the game.

This includes
 - Which board to play on
 - Which card & rule sets to include
 - Which cards to exclude
 - Select any global situation cards to play face-up right off the bat to customize the game dynamics

### Lay of the Land

Players set up the board by turning resources face-down and randomly placing them in one per tile.

*Optional: a number of face-up resources may also be placed in tiles, either by random or by consensus. If the group cannot agree to any parameters, don't do this at all.*

### Pilgrimage

Players pick their color and style of game pieces.

Players deliver ONE territory marker to each other player to represent their embassy for diplomatic engagements.

### Marching Orders

Somebody (anybody) shuffles all of the included Edict cards and places them on the table face-down.

Somebody (anybody) shuffles all of the included Global Situation cards and places them on the table face-down.

## Game Stage: Founding

During founding, players become aware of their "*legal policy*" and their "*national interests*".

### Policy Objectives

Each player secretly draws two **Edict** cards. Both take effect immediately.

If both Edicts indicate they come into play face-up or face-down, then play them that way.

Otherwise choose one to play face-up and one to play face-down.

## Game Stage: Colonization

During colonization, players establish their positions on the board.

### Settlement

Each player places any ONE Population Unit into ANY tile on the board.

Each player may secretly view the unexposed Resources on their tile.

### Exploration

Each player EXPOSES ANY ONE Resource anywhere on the map.

*(Turned face-up for all to see, keep it that way)*

### Spread

Until each player has placed as many Population Units as the total number of players, repeat the Colonization game stage now.

## Game Stage: Alignment

During alignment, players have a small amount of influence into what kind of relations they are forced into.

### Engagement

Each player draws as many Diplomatic Engagement cards as there are number of OPPONENT players. These are kept secret.

Each player choosed which Diplomatic Engagement cards to issue face down at their opponents' embassies.

### Correspondence

All players turn all issued Diplomatic Engagements face up, in view for all players to see.

Any pair of players which have issued **matching** engagements are now "*aligned*" in that relationship and their
interactions are constrained to the terms described on that card.

All other players are considered "neutral" and have no binding constraints.

## Game Stage: Contest

The contest stage repeats until global situation cards run out or some other end-game condition was struck.

### Resupply

Each player MAY send any number of resources across ANY border from any tile which they own.

### Prepare

Each player may inspect and change the Weapon Payload that is secretly loaded into all of their Population Units.

### Mobilize

Each player may mobilize any of their Population Units onto any borderland of the tile from which they originated.

*Note: This is a negotiation. Players may change their mind until everyone has agreed the phase ended.*

### Battle

All Population Units that are deployed on a tile with any number of opposing Population Units display their Weapon Payload.

Defeated units are removed from the board.

On a tie, surviving Units move back to where they came from.

### Assessment

The group turns up a new Global Situation card; follows any instructions as needed.

### Construction

Each player MAY place a Territory Marker on ANY tile that is occupied or straddled by their Population Unit.

### Fortify

All players MUST move all Population Units OFF of borderlands, onto either straddled tile.

### Convention

Players that have no more game pieces on the board are now removed from the contest, but don't lose any permanent points they gained.

If only one player has game pieces on the board, proceed to the End-Game stage.

If there was no Global Situation card available to be turned up during this round of Contest, proceed to the End-Game stage.

## Game Stage: End-Game

### Final Score

Players determine final ranks by adding their permanent points to their end-game points.
