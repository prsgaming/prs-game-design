# Edition & Revision are the *upcoming* release to which contributions are being made.
# Whenever a revision is published, this file must be updated to the next increment.

# Changes to the game play, additions and removals of game-impacting content or game piece
# compatibility should be reserved for next editions.

# Changes to language and artworks that improve aesthetics, add clarity or flavor, or other
# housekeeping needs may be included in revisions.

# As a general rule, once we advance an edition, we will not make revisions to previous
# editions, because the cost of production should be comparable between any edition & revision.

# Edition is a whole number starting with 1 (except during incubation, when it is 0).
edition: 0
# Revision is lowercase alphabetical starting with "a", restarting per each edition.
revision: a
