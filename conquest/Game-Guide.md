# Game Guide

This guide is meant to supplement the [Play Guide](./Play-Guide.md) by providing information on the components
of the game and summarized rules for the most common situations.

## Weapons

There are 3 types of weapons: "*blade*", "*bludgeon*" and "*torch*".

## Resources

There are 3 types of resources: "*metal*", "*stone*" and "*wood*".

## Weapon and Resource Relationships

There will be some situations in game play where the ability to use a weapon is linked to access to resources.

 * Torch corresponds to Wood
 * Bludgeon corresponds to Stone
 * Blade corresponds to Metal

## Combat & Combat resolution

Combat occurs when two players' population units encroach the same tile during the *mobilization* phase. When mobilization
ends, combat begins, and interacting units must display their weapons.

Combat is "*resolved*" between pairs of opposing units until no units remain opposed. A unit is defeated and removed from
the board when its weapon is vulnerable to its opposing unit's weapon.

### Weapon vulnerability order

In the spirit of Rock-Paper-Scissors,

 * Torch defeats Bludgeon
 * Bludgeon defeats Blade
 * Blade defeats Torch

## Game Pieces

The following are pieces that players will interact with throughout the course of a game.

**_Global Situation Cards_**: Global Situations act as a clock mechanism for advancing and ending the game. A new
Global Situation card is drawn during each round of the _Contest_ stage. They can describe both short term and
long term effects that modify the conditions of the game as it progresses. They will augment, enhance, or disrupt
different players strategies and objectives, benefiting some and increasing challenges for others.

**_Edict Cards_**: Edicts are occasionally drawn by individual players. Similar to Global Situations, they can have a
wide range of impacts on the overall game conditions and goals, but and Edict only directly affects the player who drew
it. Of course by directly affecting one player there will be implied indirect effects on other players. Some Edicts
come into play face up in view for everyone, and come in face down. These public and secret views are meant to represent
the difference between national policy and national interests.

**_Diplomatic Engagement Cards_**: Diplomatic Engagements cause players to propose a climate of foreign relations
with one another. They are things like "*Neutral*", "*Cold War*", "*Hot War*", "*Partnered*", "*Allied*". These are
established early on in the game prior to the main "Contest" stage. Occasionaly, Global Situations will cause players
to draw new Diplomatic Engagements and establish different relations. By default, Diplomatic Engagement are given
intentionally by each player to each other player, where the other player is not allowed to look at the card given until
the whole group of players has completed their exchanges. In the uncommon circumstance where two players issue one
another a matching pair of Diplomatic Engagements, they are considered "*aligned*" and constrained to the conditions
described on the card until something causes the whole group to perform a "*realignment*" which can replace those relations.

**_Game Board_**: (Or, "*Game Map*"). The game board is a map divided into tiles which are large enough to contain
resources and at least one Population Unit and one Territory Marker. There are some official and standard game boards, but
players can actually play the game on any sort of map that meets the technical requirements of a game board as specified
in the rule book.

**_Resource Markers_**: Resource markers will typically be captured by players and kept within their controlled territories
to increase the player's score as well as interacting with other dynamic game conditions.

**_Population Units_**: (Or, "*Military units, units, pawns*"). Population units are the primary game piece that players
move around the board to fulfill their objectives.

**_Payload Carriers_**: (Or, "*Weapons*"). Payload carriers are secretly placed beneath population units prior to
mobilizing those units throughout the board. When units encounter one another, they will engage in combat by displaying
the secretly placed payload to determine the victor of that encounter.

**_Territory Marker_**: (Or, "*Flags*"). Territory markers are occasionally placed on tiles of the map by players
to keep track of which areas are "*conquered*" by that player.

**_Embassies_**: An embassy is actually a *territory marker* piece. Each player has to exchange a territory marker with
each other player, and these are called "*embassies*". They are used to keep track of relationships between each pair
of player by association with the exchanged *Diplomatic Engagement*.

## Scoring

### End-Game Points

With no overriding effects by Global Situations and Edicts, players earn one point for each of the following:

 * Territory Markers on the board
 * Resource Markers in their territories

Cards with effects on end-game points will describe other ways points are gained or lost.

### Permanent Points

Cards with effects on permanent points will describe ways that players have gained or lost points.

### Final Score

Each player adds their permanent points to their end-game points, and are ranked accordingly.
