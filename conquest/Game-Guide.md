# Game Guide

This guide is meant to supplement the [Play Guide](./Play-Guide.md) by providing information on the components
of the game and summarized rules for the most common situations.

## Weapons

There are 3 types of weapons: "*blade*", "*bludgeon*" and "*torch*".

## Resources

There are 3 types of resources: "*metal*", "*stone*" and "*wood*".

## Weapon and Resource Relationships

There will be some situations in game play where the ability to use a weapon is linked to access to resources.

 * Torch corresponds to Wood
 * Bludgeon corresponds to Stone
 * Blade corresponds to Metal

## Combat & Combat resolution

Combat occurs when two players' population units encroach the same tile during the *mobilization* phase. When mobilization
ends, combat begins, and interacting units must display their weapons.

Combat is "*resolved*" between pairs of opposing units until no units remain opposed. A unit is defeated and removed from
the board when its weapon is vulnerable to its opposing unit's weapon.

### Weapon vulnerability order

In the spirit of Rock-Paper-Scissors,

 * Torch defeats Bludgeon
 * Bludgeon defeats Blade
 * Blade defeats Torch

### Permanent Points

Cards with effects on permanent points will describe ways that players have gained or lost points.

### Final Score

Each player adds their permanent points to their end-game points, and are ranked accordingly.
