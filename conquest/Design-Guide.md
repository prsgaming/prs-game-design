## Balancing

In general, Edicts and Situations should be self-balancing. If an effect is shown to be staggeringly damaging to the game play,
it may be removed or nerfed in a future edition.

Situations should be self-balancing simply by their nature of impacting all users equally. However there could arise scenarios
where situations and edicts interplay to give a player an immense advantage or disadvantage. It's important to remember that
in the real world of geopolitical conflict, superpowers do exist. If such a scenario is such a common disturbance that it diminishes
the play experience of the game, the game should be revised to remove it or nerf it. For example, things can be nerfed by introducing
an additional side effect, or limiting their effective time to an epoch or even a round.

Edicts should strive to be self-balancing by using "bounties" or "projects" to cause players to forego other opportunities in order
to acheive some windfall of points. They can also be designed to be double-edges, for example the Environmenalist increases the
point value of wood while assigning a negative point value to metal.
