### Setup

### Contest

#### Preparation

#### Loading Weapon Payloads

##### Common Effects

In drought & famine, a weapon may only be used in combat if the necessary resource is in a tile it straddles. However, if the player has "railway", the necessary resource can be in any tile as long as there is an uninterupted path to it, where that path is conquered or uncontested tiles controlled by that player.

### Scoring

# Combat

## Resolution

Combat is considered "resolved" once players figure out all the winners and losers.

# Scoring

## Endgame Points

Players add the number of territory markers and resources in their uncontested controlled tiles.

## Permanent Points

Players must keep track of permanent points as they are earned throughout the game, for example when success criteria is met for "Project" edicts.

## Effect Points

Players assess the gains and losses of points as described by effects of situations and edicts.

## Final Score

Players evaluate the sum of ther Endgame, Permanent & Effect points and compare ranks using those points.

If a player was eradicated from the game, they still assess their permanent & effect points and therefore could potentially the high rank.

## The end

You can't actually win. You can only rank your points for stature and force projection.
