# Game Setup

## Map

Standard maps are supplied with the game edition, but non-standard maps are also able to be used in tournament as decided either by
a tournament authority or by agreement among players.

# Game progression

## Stages & Phases

### Setup

### Contest

#### Resupply

##### Stacking Resources

Resources are able to be stacked on a tile to no limit within reason.

To alleviate ridiculousness, if a player's stack falls over by accident, each resource remains on the tile it stopped on unless
it fell into a tile controlled by that player in which case it is returned to the original stack.

As a tip, you can stay organized by keeping your stacks of the same type of resource.

#### Preparation

#### Loading Weapon Payloads

##### Common Effects

In drought & famine, a weapon may only be used in combat if the necessary resource is in a tile it straddles. However, if the player has "railway", the necessary resource can be in any tile as long as there is an uninterupted path to it, where that path is conquered or uncontested tiles controlled by that player.

## Epochs

## Endgame

### Endgame Conditions

### Scoring

# Combat

## Resolution

Combat is considered "resolved" once players figure out all the winners and losers.

# Scoring

## Endgame Points

Players add the number of territory markers and resources in their uncontested controlled tiles.

## Permanent Points

Players must keep track of permanent points as they are earned throughout the game, for example when success criteria is met for "Project" edicts.

## Effect Points

Players assess the gains and losses of points as described by effects of situations and edicts.

## Final Score

Players evaluate the sum of ther Endgame, Permanent & Effect points and compare ranks using those points.

If a player was eradicated from the game, they still assess their permanent & effect points and therefore could potentially the high rank.

## The end

You can't actually win. You can only rank your points for stature and force projection.

# Game component specifications

## Map specifications

Tiles may be irregular shapes, but every tile must share a borderland with at least two other tiles.

Tiles must be large enough to fully contain at least one population unit and 4 resource units.

Every valid borderland must be long enough that at least one population unit can fit on it while straddling
exactly two tiles. (Population units straddling 3 or more tiles on a borderland is disallowed in game play).

Partially isolated regions are allowed as long as there are no islands. There may be peninsulas and bridges
as long as the tiles within meet the other specifications mentioned in this section.

### Standard Maps

Standard maps will have more than one path of travel in and out of distinctive regions.

## Game piece specifications

### Game piece media

This section summarizes the game piece media options as specified by the "Power Resource & Sovereignty Standard Game Piece Suite"

#### Plastic Flat (Standard, Official)

Plastic Flat game pieces are standard for being economical and relatively easy to safely move around the
board without exposing secrets.

#### Plastic Premium (Official)

Plastic Premium game pieces are interoperable with their "Flat" counterparts, but are taller and easy to move
around the board without accidentally exposing secrets, and they have a specific aesthetic quality.

#### Paper Premium (Official)

Paper Premium pieces are made of chipboard and have similar sizing specifications with their "Plastic" counterparts.
They are designed to be interopable with the Plastic pieces, though it might not be an ideal experience.

The purpose of Paper Premium is mainly for players who want to make their own pieces but do not have access to a
3d printer.

#### Paper Flat (Official)

Paper Flat pieces do not easily interoperate with any other piece. They are meant to be easily printed by anyone with
a color printer. They are weakest in ergonomics and operational security on the board, however they make
the game quickly accessible to players who lack access to 3d printing or budget to purchase other pieces.

### Standard game pieces

Standard game piece models & specifications are made available, but may change across editions and revisions.

The standard game pieces are modified objects of the "Power Resource & Sovereignty Standard Game Piece Suite".
This rulebook will defer to those specifications for dimensions and other details.

See the table below for a mapping of Conquest game pieces to PRS Standard Game Pieces

 * Population Unit: Bomb Bay Pawn
 * Territory Marker: Bomb Bay Flag
 * Weapon Carrier: Payload Disc
 * Resource Token: Stacking Token

### Labels & Artworks

[] to do

### Optionally Neutral Pieces

Weapon Carriers and Resource Tokens are effectively neutral. However, standard game piece sets include
neutral "gray" pieces as well as player-specific pieces. The player specific pieces are mainly included
to ensure that there are enough neutral pieces to go around.

Therefore, it is permissible for a green player's population unit to carry a blue player's weapon.

The advantage of player-specific neutral pieces is that when it's time to clean up or reset, it's easy
for players to identify their belongings. It also helps make sure your stock of out of play weapons are
balanced which helps with secrecy when preparing your population units.

### Custom & alternative game pieces

As long players agree, players may use their own custom game pieces either designed fully from
scratch or derived from the standard game pieces.

#### Conformity of game pieces

Game pieces have certain interoperability and players should be able to interoperate with
each others game pieces.

For example, weapon payloads need to be able to be hidden within population units in a way that they can
safely and secretly be moved around the map without exposure. To a lesser degree this is true of territory
markers as well.

If players design their own game pieces, if they do not conform to the interoperability specifications
of the standard pieces, they should at least conform to one another to avoid reduction in playability.

#### Sizing Discrepancies

The requirements of the "Map specifications" must be true of the largest version of each game piece
on the board.

Different sized versions of game pieces may not use their size as an advantage, therefore however many of
the largest game piece fits on a part of the board, the smaller pieces are also limited to that number even
if they physically could fit more.

### Player Identification

Game pieces owned by a player must be recognizable as owned by that player, particularly territory markers
and population units.

This can be done by distinctive solid colors, or patterns, or flag designs or distinctive materials (such
as wood or metal).

Typically with plastic pieces it will be done with color, and with paper pieces it will be done with flag
designs.

### Operational Security

Neutral pieces like resource tokens and weapon carriers tend to have periods of visibility but secrecy of
their values.

It is important to avoid pieces that have obvious blemishes that can make their values easily recognizable
while covered.

#### Mixing styles of neutral pieces

Make a best effort to reduce the number of different styles of neutral pieces on the board to help reduce
the chance that their secret values become detectable.
