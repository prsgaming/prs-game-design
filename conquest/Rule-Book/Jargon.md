# Game Pieces

## **Global Situation Cards**
Global Situations act as a clock mechanism for advancing and ending the game. A new
Global Situation card is drawn during each round of the _Contest_ stage. They can describe both short term and
long term effects that modify the conditions of the game as it progresses. They will augment, enhance, or disrupt
different players strategies and objectives, benefiting some and increasing challenges for others.

## **Edict Cards**
 Edicts are occasionally drawn by individual players. Similar to Global Situations, they can have a
wide range of impacts on the overall game conditions and goals, but and Edict only directly affects the player who drew
it. Of course by directly affecting one player there will be implied indirect effects on other players. Some Edicts
come into play face up in view for everyone, and come in face down. These public and secret views are meant to represent
the difference between national policy and national interests.

## **Diplomatic Engagement Cards**
 Diplomatic Engagements cause players to propose a climate of foreign relations
with one another. They are things like "*Neutral*", "*Cold War*", "*Hot War*", "*Partnered*", "*Allied*". These are
established early on in the game prior to the main "Contest" stage. Occasionaly, Global Situations will cause players
to draw new Diplomatic Engagements and establish different relations. By default, Diplomatic Engagement are given
intentionally by each player to each other player, where the other player is not allowed to look at the card given until
the whole group of players has completed their exchanges. In the uncommon circumstance where two players issue one
another a matching pair of Diplomatic Engagements, they are considered "*aligned*" and constrained to the conditions
described on the card until something causes the whole group to perform a "*realignment*" which can replace those relations.

## **Game Board**
 (Or, "*Game Map*"). The game board is a map divided into tiles which are large enough to contain
resources and at least one Population Unit and one Territory Marker. There are some official and standard game boards, but
players can actually play the game on any sort of map that meets the technical requirements of a game board as specified
in the rule book.

## **Resource Markers**
 Resource markers will typically be captured by players and kept within their controlled territories
to increase the player's score as well as interacting with other dynamic game conditions.

## **Population Units**
 (Or, "*Military units, units, pawns*"). Population units are the primary game piece that players
move around the board to fulfill their objectives.

## **Payload Carriers**
 (Or, "*Weapons*"). Payload carriers are secretly placed beneath population units prior to
mobilizing those units throughout the board. When units encounter one another, they will engage in combat by displaying
the secretly placed payload to determine the victor of that encounter.

## **Territory Marker**
 (Or, "*Flags*"). Territory markers are occasionally placed on tiles of the map by players
to keep track of which areas are "*conquered*" by that player.

## **Embassies**
 An embassy is actually a *territory marker* piece. Each player has to exchange a territory marker with
each other player, and these are called "*embassies*". They are used to keep track of relationships between each pair
of player by association with the exchanged *Diplomatic Engagement*.

## **Tile**
A _tile_ is a location in the map that can harbor population units and resources.

## **Borderland**
A _borderland_ is any edge between a pair of tiles, and is distinct to exactly two tiles.

# Rules

## Tiles

### **Controlled Tile**
A _controlled_ tile is one that has at least one population unit or territory marker within it.

### **Uncontrolled Tile**
An _uncontrolled_ tile is one has no player game pieces within it or on any of its borderlands.

### **Conquered Tile**
A _conquered_ tile is one that has at least one territory marker within it.

### **Contested Tile**
A _contested_ tile is one that contains or is straddled by game pieces belonging to more than one player.

### **Uncontested Tile**
An _uncontested_ tile is one that contains or is straddled by game pieces belong to exactly one player.

## **Territory**
A _territory_ is any number of contiguously controlled tiles (including one single tile).

# Common Effects

## **Effect**
An _effect_ is a condition or set of conditions or abilities which override the base mechanics of the game as described in the rulebook.

## **Drought**
A _drought_ is a condition that prevents players from preparing for battle unless that population unit has direct access to a resource corresponding to the weapon.

### **Minor Drought**
Like _drought_ but any resource type can satisfy the use of any weapon type.

### **Wood Drought**
A _drought_ that only impacts torches, by requiring wood.

### **Metal Drought**
A _drought_ that only impacts blades, by requiring metal.

### **Stone Drought**
A _drought_ that only impacts bludgeons, by requiring stone.

## **Famine**
A _famine_ prevents players from preparing for battle unless that population unit has direct access to a resource corresponding to the weapon, and that resource is
removed from the board *if* that population unit actuals goes to combat.

(Like a _drought_, but more severe)

### **Minor Famine**
Like _famine_, but any resource type can satisfy the use of any weapon type.

### **Wood Famine**
A _famine_ that only impacts torches, by requiring wood.

### **Metal Famine**
A _famine_ that only impacts blades, by requiring metal.

### **Stone Famine**
A _famine_ that only impacts bludgeons, by requiring stone.

### **Stronghold**
A _stronghold_ enables territory markers (flags) to repel incoming attacks by allowing them to be prepared with payloads prior to mobilization and giving them first-strike advantage.

(Note: successfully repelled attacks do not remove invaders from the game, but only sends them back across the borderland)

### **Railway**
A _railway_ enables players to mobilize their game pieces (population units, resources, and territory markers) to any tile that is connected by an uninterrupted chain of tiles they control, but not onto borderlands of contested tiles or tiles controlled by other players. (For that, they would have to wait another round and start from the tile abutting that borderland.)
